# ResourceCalculator-Tile-Multiplier
A small python script I wrote to help automate multiplying resources based on how many times I need to craft something in any given game. This project was initially made for making "tileable" redstone contraptions in Minecraft (hence the name), but could be useful in any project.

## How to:
Just Copy and paste the output from ResourceGenerator into resources.txt, and run the script. It'll ask how many times you want to tile your build. Enter whatever, and watch as your time gets saved doing math by hand!
